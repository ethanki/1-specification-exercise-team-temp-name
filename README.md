## Stakeholders

The following is an interview conducted with Eddie Kim a Student Athlete at NYU in his Sophomore year, interviewed by Eric Emmendorfer.

Start of Interview

Q: So Eddie, you are currently a college student athlete, what do you think is the hardest part about doing both school and sports?
A: I think the hardest part for me has been time management. It has been hard to get all of my work on time during weeks where practice feels extraordinarily long, or we are traveling for a tournament. 

Q: Do you have any calendar apps that you use to help you keep track of assignments?
A: Yes, I do however, I often forget about big assignments until the day before when I see them in my calendar app and sometimes I do not have time to complete them with practice and traveling.

Q: Do you use Brightspace, to look at whats coming up to help manage the bigger task?
A: Yes I do, however when I am on the move and I try to use brightspace on my phone it is pretty hard to use and hard to see everything. 

Q: Aside from homework and test, are there any other things regarding school you try to keep track of?
A: I am constantly concerned about my grades, I look at them often but it can be hard to know how I am actually doing when professors are slow to update assignments in Brightspace or they are not weighted correctly. 

Q: What about when going to school or practice, are you able look to help keep track of what you should be getting done during any given day?
A: No, I take the subway to both school and practice so normally I can not look to see Brightspace or Albert because I do not get good service in the subways. 

Eric: I see, thank you for your time Eddie.

End of Interview

Problems identified: Time management for task, reminders of task further in advence, mobile viewing for school websites, keeping track of grades, being able to see all of this offline or with spotty service. 

## Product Vision Statement

The vision for our project is to create an app that allows students to better manage their school work. The product will have the ability for students to add their courses and assignments in order to help them better manage their school work. Assignments will allow for individuals to set their due dates on a calendar view as well as set reminders of when they should be starting them. Classes will allow a way for students to see their grades in a given class, and update them based of off grades recieved and the weight of assignments. This app will be an easy to use task manager and progress checker to help students accomplish their academic goals.
